			\item  Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning .
			\item  Data science , statistics and economics are works with data,this is the close relation.
			\item Data science is also  revolutionising  some of the sectors in which economists work: e.g. banking, finance, public policy and consulting.

	\begin{frame}[t]{Popularity of R and Python for Data Science}
		
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item R and Python are the most reliable open source statistical software for data science
			\item  Easy to Learn
			\item  A primary reason that data scientists use open-source tools is the ability to modify the programs and code that the software relies on
			\item Using open-source software is especially useful for data scientists that want to work with libraries and other data science tools that are regularly updated. 
			\item Part of the open-source movement, which created a community of programmers who are committed to editing and updating programs and code.

			Science,KDnuggets,Simply Statistics,Data Science Central,Rbloggers,Github,Kaggle,Smart Data collective etc.
			\item \textbf {Data analytics you tube
			channels:} Statquest,Simplilearn,freecodecamp.org,Edureka,sentdex,Great 
			Learning,Ken Jee etc.
			\item \textbf{Choosing a Language:}
				 Despite being extremely powerful, \emph{Python/ R} is an easy language for a beginner to pick up, so give it a try! 
			
			\item Learning the language from available resources and try to understand the code
			\item Teaching yourself

	\begin{frame}[t]{Team Collaboration in R and Python}
		
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility across R and Python workflows are essential for bilingual teams that wish to undertake significant data research while enabling experts to work in their preferred language (s).
			\item \textbf {Adopt a Bilingual IDE}
			The RStudio IDE is perfect for this. It can Combine R and Python in a single script
			\item \textbf{Interoperable Enterprise Ecosystem}	R and Python code collaboration is made possible by RStudio Workbench, a safe, scalable, and centralized environment
			\item The uniform structure and opinionated syntax of a well-defined grammar enable standardization across code bases. Users of R and Python can utilize the tools dplyr, siuba, and ggplot2 to adopt a uniform syntax for data processing and visualization, respectively

			\column{0.5\linewidth} {\textbf {Rule 3 : Adopt Good Practices and Be Consistent}}
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Starting from pseudocode:
				If you are new in any kind of programming  language , you may benefit from starting your project with psudocode.
				
				\item   Try direct coding : If you think you are comfortable by doing , you should write code directly 
				\item   Coding style : A coding style is a  bunch  of guidelines  which we use to write code perfectly.It is a collection of specific functions, packages and syntax strategies.
				\item  Set your working directory: Project directory in R is the folder where   we are working . Hence it’s the place (Environment) where we have to store files of our project.
				
			\end{itemize}
			
			\column{0.5\linewidth} {\textbf{Rule 4: Join the R community}}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item 	Offline Community 
				\item  	Online Community

\begin{frame}[t]{Data Analysis}
The data in FERTIL2 were collected on \emph{women living} in the Republic of Botswana in 1988. 
There are \textbf{ 4360} observations of \textbf{ 27 }variables.\\
Here we choose some variables. These are
\begin{itemize}
	\item Years of education (educ)
	\item Having electricity (electric)
	\item Live in urban area (urban)
	\item Number of living children (children)
\end{itemize}
The variables \textbf{ electric} and \textbf{ urban} are binary indicators equal to one if 
the woman’s home has electricity and live in urban, and zero if not.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]{Quantitative Analysis}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The smallest and largest values of children in the sample are \textbf{ 0} and \textbf{ 13}. \textbf{Average children:2}
		
		\item Approximately\textbf{ 14 percent} of women have electricity in the home
		
		\item Average children with electricity 2 and without electricity 3.\textbf{ Clearly the electricity households have fewer children}
		\item There is no direct relationship between having electricity and woman have fewer child but may be influence of electricity devices like TV and radio are more likely to promote fewer children and more liberal thoughts.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Hypothesis}
	\textbf{H0:} There is no difference in average years of education due to electricity.\\
	\textbf	{H0:} There is no difference in average year of education due to urban and non-urban.\\
	\textbf{H0:} The effect of one independent variable on average education per year does not depend on the effect of the other independent variable.\\
	
	\textbf{	Ha:} There is a difference in average years of education due to electricity.\\
	\textbf{	Ha:} There is a difference in average year of education due to urban and non-urban.\\
	\textbf{	Ha:}There is an interaction effect between electricity and live in urban on average year of education.

\begin{frame}[t]{Summary}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The p-value of electric is <2e-16 (significant), which indicates that the levels of electric are associated with significant different in education.
		\item The p-value of urban is <2e-16 (significant), which indicates that the levels of urban are associated with significant different in education.
		\item The p-value for the interaction between electric*urban is 7.06e-10(significant), which indicates that the relationships between urban and education depends on the electricity.
